## Getting Started
First, run the development server (ensure that backend server is running):
```
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  with your browser to see the result. 

If backend server is running on port 3000, you should navigate to [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3000)

### Ensure that all .env variables are set 

.env
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_REACT_APP_API_URL= {url where backend server is running}
NEXT_PUBLIC_REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID= {google client id for google OAuth 2.0 }
```
